### http-server

Java has a very good networking support, it allows you to write client server application by using <b>TCP Sockets</b>.
In this learning project, I will create a simple HTTP Server in Java, which can listen HTTP request on
a port let's say 80 and can send response to client. Being an HTTP Server, you can connect to it using your
browser e.g. Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer.
